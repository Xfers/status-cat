### Non Heroku Configuration - Setup

**Step 1:** Rename `CONFIGURATION.sample.php` to `CONFIGURATION.php`

**Step 2:** Edit `CONFIGURATION.php` following the instructions.

**Step 3:** Put it on your server. Enjoy.

### Non Heroku Configuration - Server

Hopefully, you will never have to do any of this if you're using the one click Heroku deploy. Of course, many people will want to deploy this in other places, so here's a run down.

#### Server Requirements
- PHP 7

#### Apache

By default, the following `.htaccess` file in the `/public` directory.

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]

AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/text text/html text/plain text/xml text/css text/javascript application/x-javascript application/javascript application/json
```

#### IIS

For IIS you will need to install URL Rewrite for IIS and then add the following rule to your `web.config`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <rewrite>
          <rule name="Toro" stopProcessing="true">
            <match url="^(.*)$" ignoreCase="false" />
              <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
                <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
                <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
                <add input="{R:1}" pattern="^(index\.php)" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
              </conditions>
            <action type="Rewrite" url="/index.php/{R:1}" />
          </rule>
        </rewrite>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

#### Nginx

Under the `server` block of your virtual host configuration, you only need to add three lines.
```conf
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
}
```

### What are all these files in the root directory?

Here is a quick explanation of them:

| File              |                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /public/.htaccess | This is a default override file for Apache servers. Heroku uses it as well.                                |
| /public/.user.ini | This is a default override on the memory limit for Heroku. This enables 25 PHP processes.                  |
| /public/index.php | This is the entry point into the application.                                                              |
| app.json          | This is a configuration file for the one click Heroku deploy.                                              |
| composer.json     | This is a configuration file for autoloading components.                                                   |
| composer.lock     | This is used for the composer.json. Don't touch this or the json, they've already been optimized for you.  |
| CONFIGURATION.php | This is the ONLY file you should touch. It holds all the settings for the status page.                     |
| Procfile          | This is a configuration file for Heroku.                                                                   |
| README.md         | This is the readme                                                                                         |
| /app/             | This is where the application logic is.

You will never have to touch anything within the /app/ folder. If you are not using Heroku, your data will be stored in /app/data/
